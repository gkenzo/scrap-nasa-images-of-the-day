JavaScript's Puppeteer webscrapping NASA's image of the day


My first tryout with JS puppeeters webscraping. I've used it to access NASA's images of the day and download all the photos that are displayed in that page.

If you want to try it one:
close this repo,
certify that you have npm install,
run npm install,
then npm run start or node index.js in that directory
